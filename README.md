Game Overview:
  The title is Moonlit Pilgrimage. The premise is that the player is a misunderstood journalist on a solo journey to find proof of the Fresno Nightcrawlers. On their way to California, they suddenly wake up in the middle of a forest with no recollection of how they got there. They decide that the best way to get out of this situation is to make their way to a radio tower in the distance. 
  
  World: 
    The world of the game is whimsical in nature. The player will encounter strange creatures that have been documented in folklore and myth. Some creatures are more friendly than others, but all have a certain charm to them. The main character will find plenty of items of a similar uncanny nature as they explore this strange forest. 
    
    Characters: 
      The player encounters many interesting characters as they go on their journey. A pair of sibling frogs, a rock with a vengeance, a dapper-looking skeleton, and many more. The player can interact with most of these characters and some even have dedicated menus for you to talk to them with or barter with. 
      
      Player Goals: 
       The ultimate goal is to leave the forest. The player can achieve this in multiple ways. The original mission is to make it the radio tower, but the player might discover alternative ways to exit this forest if they meet the requirements.
